#ta-materials

These are things I wrote while TAing. Just some things I made either for student consumption (like practice questions) or for my personal use (like scripts to help me grade and the like).

## UIUC

###cs492

I was a TA for CS 492 and CS 493/494 (Senior Projects) and among other things, worked to automate a lot of manual tasks which would've been incredibly painful.

## Syracuse University

###cis252

I served as a grader/TA for CIS 252 (Introduction to Computer Science), primarily responsible for holding office hours and writing sample exam questions.

###cis352

I was the sole TA for CIS 352 (Programming Languages), responsible for grading and holding office hours. You'll find scripts I wrote to help me autograde a lot of the introductory stuff.
